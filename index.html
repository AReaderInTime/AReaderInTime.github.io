        <p class="writings">Hello world! Welcome to my first blog post! I am excited to be writing this and telling you all about my life and what I've been up to lately. I am 17, love reading books and writing. My favorite class in school is my AP Lit/Comp class. Outside of school, I like to take my cats outside to chase bugs and enjoy the fresh air. I also like to watch shows on Netflix in my free time, including The Office and Drop Dead Diva. </p>

       <p class="writings"> Hello again! I wanted to pop in and talk about what I plan on doing after high school. I would like to attend college here where I live. From there, I want to pursue getting my bacholers degree in Business Administration. After I graduate high school, I want to move onto getting a government job that pays well. From there, I will work my way to the top of the "food chain", so to speak and try to get as far as I can and get paid the best I can. </p>
